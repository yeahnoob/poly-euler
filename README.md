# Polyglottic Euler in 5 Lambdas

Polyglottic attempts to euler in Clojure, Common Lisp (SBCL), Racket, SML and
Haskell. The codes will be refactored from time to time without 
deleting old codes.

## About the Lisps

"*Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you
will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a
better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never
actually use Lisp itself a lot*." - Eric Raymond, "How to Become a
Hacker"

## Rationales

1. The need for benchmark for a particular euler problem in terms of speed
2. Encouragement for others to come up with faster/better solutions
3. PE problems are good practice for optimising codes, which is critical skill in the era of big-data

In every source code, time-elapsed for each solution will be listed.

Implementations:  
1. Clojure using Clojure on JVM  
2. Clojurescript on NodeJS  
3. Common Lisp using SBCL  
4. Haskell using GHC (currently still in interpreted mode, will be moved to compiled one)  
5. SML using SMLNJ  
6. Racket using Racket

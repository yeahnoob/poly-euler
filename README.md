# Polyglottic Euler in 4 Lambdas

Polyglottic attempts to euler in Clojure, Common Lisp (SBCL), Racket, and
Haskell. The codes will be refactored from time to time without 
deleting old codes.

## About the Lisps

"*Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you
will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a
better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never
actually use Lisp itself a lot*." - Eric Raymond, "How to Become a
Hacker"

In every source code, time-elapsed for each solution will be listed.

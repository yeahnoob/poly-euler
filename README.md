# poly-euler

Personal polyglottic attempts to euler in Clojure, CLisp, and
Haskell. I will refactor from time to time without deleting old codes. 

## Usage

You can run lein autoexpects for clojure.

In every source, I will list the time-elapsed for each solution. 

## Performance Comparison in my MBA i5 1.6GHz

##### Problem no 25

Prob: Find the first fibo element that reach 1000 digits.

Clojure averaging 2.9 msecs  
Clisp averaging 1.3 msecs  
Haskell averaging 20 msecs  

Note: I need to learn more about optimizing haskell codes.

# Polyglottic Euler in 3 Lambdas

Personal polyglottic attempts to euler in Clojure, Common Lisp (SBCL), and
Haskell. I will refactor from time to time without deleting old codes.

## Usage

You can run lein autoexpects for clojure.

In every source, I will list the time-elapsed for each solution. 

## Performance Comparison in my MBA i5 1.6GHz

##### Problem no 1

Prob: Find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 that less than 1000

Clojure averaging 3.2 msecs  
SBCL averaging 0.3 msecs  
Haskell averaging 10 msecs  

##### Problem no 2

Prob: Find the sum of even-valued fibo numbers less than 4,000,000

Clojure 0.08msecs  
SBCL less than 0.01msecs  
Haskell ~10msecs  

##### Problem no 3

Prob: Find the largest prime factor of 600851475143

Clojure 32 msecs  
SBCL 37-42 msecs  
Haskell 1,420 msecs  

##### Problem no 4

Prob: Find the largest palindrom that is a product of two 3 digits
number (can be different numbers).

Clojure 16-18 msecs  
SBCL 18-20 msecs  
Haskell 30 msecs  

##### Problem no 25

Prob: Find the first fibo element that reach 1000 digits.

Clojure averaging 2.9 msecs  
SBCL averaging 1.3 msecs  
Haskell averaging 20 msecs  

Note: I need to learn more about optimizing haskell codes.

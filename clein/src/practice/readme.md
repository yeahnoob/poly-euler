Functions that need to be implemented:

Basic collection manipulation
take, drop, take-while, drop-while, keep, keep-index, map-index, map, etc

Math functions:
1. sum & product of a collection  
2. factorial  
3. prime? Int -> Bool  
4. primes-under (returns all primes under a certain number)  
5. primes-range (takes i & j and returns ith to jth primes)  
6. fibo  
7. fibolist  
8. numcol (returns a list of digits of a number)  
9. colnum (returns a number from a list of its digits, it's the inverse function of numcol)  
10. factors (returns all factors of a number)  
11. pfactors (returns all prime factors of a number)  
12. sum-factors (returns the sum of all factors of a number)

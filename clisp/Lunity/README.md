Stupid attempt to make Clojure/Haskell functions available in Common Lisp

### Usage

simply (load "clojure.lisp") and/or (load "haskell.lisp")

Not so much an implementation of both languages on CL, simply made the superficial attempt  
so that I can call things like range, iterate, etc.

Also, I added some common mathematical functions.

### Here are the list of functions that already implemented:
